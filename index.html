            Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.The ability to learn is possessed by humans, non-human animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.

                Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before in terms of an embryo's need for both the interaction with, and freedom within its environment within the womb. and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment. The nature and Montain processes involved in learning are studied in many established fields including educational maintal psychology,neuropsychology, experimental psychology, cognitive sciences, and pedagogy as well as emerging fields of knowledge with a shared interest in the topic of learning from safety events such as incidents accidents.

                Play has been approached by several theorists as a form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games. For Vygotsky, however, play is the first form of learning language and communication, and the stage where a child begins to understand rules and symbols.
                This has led to a view that learning in organisms is always related to semiosis, and is often associated with representational systems activity.
